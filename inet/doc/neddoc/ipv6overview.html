<h2>IPv6 model overview</h2>
<p>IPv6 support is implemented by several cooperating modules. The <a href="inet.networklayer.ipv6.IPv6.html">IPv6</a> module
implements IPv6 datagram handling (sending, forwarding etc). It relies on
<a href="inet.networklayer.ipv6.RoutingTable6.html">RoutingTable6</a> to get access to the routes. <a href="inet.networklayer.ipv6.RoutingTable6.html">RoutingTable6</a> also contains the
neighbour discovery data structures (destination cache, neighbour cache,
prefix list -- the latter effectively merged into the route table). Interface
configuration (address, state, timeouts etc) is held in the <a href="inet.networklayer.common.InterfaceTable.html">InterfaceTable</a>,
in <tt>IPv6InterfaceData</tt> objects attached to <tt>InterfaceEntry</tt>
as its <tt>ipv6()</tt> member.</p>
<p>The module <a href="inet.networklayer.icmpv6.IPv6NeighbourDiscovery.html">IPv6NeighbourDiscovery</a> implements all tasks associated with
neighbour discovery and stateless address autoconfiguration. The data
structures themselves (destination cache, neighbour cache, prefix list)
are kept in <a href="inet.networklayer.ipv6.RoutingTable6.html">RoutingTable6</a>, and are accessed via public C++ methods.
Neighbour discovery packets are only sent and processed by this module --
when <a href="inet.networklayer.ipv6.IPv6.html">IPv6</a> receives one, it forwards the packet to <a href="inet.networklayer.icmpv6.IPv6NeighbourDiscovery.html">IPv6NeighbourDiscovery</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of ICMPv6 (ICMP errors, echo request/reply etc) is implemented in
the module <a href="inet.networklayer.icmpv6.ICMPv6.html">ICMPv6</a>, just like with IPv4. ICMP errors are sent into
<a href="inet.networklayer.ipv6.IPv6ErrorHandling.html">IPv6ErrorHandling</a>, which the user can extend or replace to get errors
handled in any way they like.</p>
