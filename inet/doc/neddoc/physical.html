<h2>Ethernet: Messaging on the Physical Layer</h2>
<p>Messages sent by <a href="inet.linklayer.ethernet.EtherMAC.html">EtherMAC</a> mark the beginning of a transmission.
The end of a transmission is not explicitly represented by a message,
but instead, the <a href="inet.linklayer.ethernet.EtherMAC.html">EtherMAC</a> calculates it from the frame length and
the transmission rate. Frames are represented by <a href="EtherFrame.html">EtherFrame</a>.</p>
<p>When frames collide, the transmission is aborted -- in this case
<a href="inet.linklayer.ethernet.EtherMAC.html">EtherMAC</a> makes use of the modelled jam signals to figure out
when colliding transmissions end.</p>
<p>When a transmitting station senses a collision, it transmits a jam signal.
Jam signals are represented by a <a href="EtherJam.html">EtherJam</a> message.
When <a href="inet.linklayer.ethernet.EtherMAC.html">EtherMAC</a> received a jam signal, it knows that one transmission
has ended in jamming -- thus when it receives as many jam messages
as colliding frames, it can be sure all transmissions have been aborted.</p>
<p>Receiving a jam message marks the beginning (and not the end)
of a jam signal, so actually <a href="inet.linklayer.ethernet.EtherMAC.html">EtherMAC</a> has to wait for the duration
of the jamming before assuming the channel is free again.</p>
