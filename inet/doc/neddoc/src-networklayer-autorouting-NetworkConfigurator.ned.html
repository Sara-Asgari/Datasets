// Configures \IP addresses and routing tables for a network.
//
// This module does't connect to any other modules (it has no gates),
// and should have only one instance in the whole model. The module
// will only run once, at the beginning of the simulation.
// When it runs, it will:
//
//   -#  assign \IP addresses to hosts and routers.
//   -#  then it'll discover the topology of the network (using OMNeT++'s
//       cTopology class), and calculate shortest paths;
//   -#  finally, it will add routes which correspond to the shortest
//       paths to the routing tables (see RoutingTable::addRoutingEntry()).
//
// How does it know which modules are routers, hosts, et.c that need to
// be configured, and what is the network topology? The configurator
// picks all modules which have a @node property and their connections,
// and builds a graph from it. Then it runs Dijstra's shortest path
// algorithm on it.
//
// To avoid interference with the above algorithm, it's recommended that
// no host or router should have its address set explicitly, and
// no routes are set up manually. Practically, routing files (.irt, .mrt)
// should be absent or empty.
//
// All the above takes place in initialization stage 2. (In stage 0,
// interfaces register themselves in the InterfaceTable modules, and
// in stage 1, routing files are read.)
