# Benchmark Datasets for Worm Propagation Studies
We generated two categories of datasets, each of which contains several sets of traffic traces. the simulated worms are Slammer, Code Red I, Code Red II, and modified versions of them. these datasets have been generated in two different networks with different background traffic. for more details on how we generated these datasets, worm parameters, infection network parameters, and so on, see [our](https://ijict.itrc.ac.ir/browse.php?a_id=451&slc_lang=en&sid=1&printcase=1&hbnr=1&hmb=1) [papers](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9345845).<br />

This repo contains the source code of INET and ReaSE (along with the modifications we made in them) that can be used for generating additional datasets. Moreover, our generated datasets are available in [https://github.com/WormDatasets/Datasets](https://github.com/WormDatasets/Datasets).
